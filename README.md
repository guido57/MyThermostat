    - BOOT_COMPLETED -> it starts JobService
    - SMS_RECEIVED -> it processes the received SMS
- MyJobService runs silently and continuosly, even when screen is off or the device is in sleep mode. 
- The MainActivity contains a ListView to log all the SMS received and sent
- The ProfileActivity contains a RecyclerView with the following items:
    - 1 Button ButtonAddFrom to add one or more "From" items
    - EditView "From" item to set one SMS sender
    - 1 Button ButtonAddTo to add one or more "To" items
    - EditView "To" item to set one SMS recipient
    - 1 Button ButtonAddFilter  to add one or more "Filter" item 
    - EditView "Filter" item to set one SMS test message filter, accepting Regular Espression (REGEX) sintax, as:
